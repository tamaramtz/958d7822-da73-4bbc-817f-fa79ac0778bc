#What does it means when the internal-rate of return is greater than the hurdle rate?
#If the IRR exceeds the hurdle rate, the project would most likely be executed. Because the investment creates value.

#Can the net present value be negative? Why?
#Yes, because it means that when the value of the outflows is greater than the inflows, the NPV is negative.
